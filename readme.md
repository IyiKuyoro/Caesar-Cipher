This is a web page that encrypts text using the Caesar cipher
encryption method. Details about this can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

This project is to encrypt the text using a left rotation of 5.

I created a cryptographer class to do the encryption and decryption of the any text. The constructor contains a large chunk of the code because I wanted to encapsulate the actual encryption process.
